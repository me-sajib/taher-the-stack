## Log in to the proxy manager account üèÉüèª

Users can log in with their proxy manager dashboard credentials. Let's login with the previous credentials. After login, the proxy list is automatically fetched from the account. Under the hood, this is calling the **GET** `/api/proxy-list` API. All fetched proxy lists will appear in another table.

Furthermore, users can check their proxy list by pressing the `check` button. In order of priority, all proxies retrieved will appear at the top of the popup HTML.
