This API allows users to manage their accounts and proxy lists. Users can sign up for a new account or sign in to an existing account, reset their password, delete their account, and update their account information.

Besides, it provides functionality for managing proxy lists, including the ability to retrieve all proxy lists, retrieve a specific proxy list, create a new proxy list, update existing proxy lists, delete proxy lists, and check the status of proxies within a proxy list.

Furthermore, proxy list management allows users to retrieve, create, update, and delete individual proxies within a proxy list. All of these features are accessible through a series of well-documented endpoints, making it easy for developers to integrate the API into their applications.
